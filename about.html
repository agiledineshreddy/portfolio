	<section id="biography">
		<h2 class="heading">Biography</h2>
		<p class="con">I am Agile Dinesh Reddy, born on 21st March 2001, and raised in the vibrant town of Mudigubba, Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh. My fascination with technology began at an early age, inspired by its potential to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. This passion led me to pursue a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from DRK Institute of Technology and Science (DRKIST), where I graduated with a CGPA of 6.4.

			Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently demonstrated my dedication to learning and growth. My educational path started at Sun Shine EM High School, where I achieved a percentage of 85%, and continued at Narayana Junior College, where I secured a percentage of 85%.
			
			I have developed a strong technical skill set, including UI Technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and programming languages like Python and Django. I also have experience with databases, specifically MySQL. These skills have been further honed through my projects, notably the "Car Popularity Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach," where I contributed as a team member, utilizing Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict car popularity based on various features.
			
			In addition to my academic and project work, I developed and deployed a comprehensive portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and achievements. This website, accessible at https://dineshportfolio-agiledineshreddys-projects.vercel.app/, reflects my commitment to excellence and continuous improvement.</p>

			<li ><strong>Car Popularity Prediction: A Machine Learning</strong>: 
				
				Name of the project is  Car Popularity Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach. in this project we used 
				machine learning algorithms to predict car popularity.  We use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm with an RBF kernel to build our model. The SVM classifier is trained on features from the training data, such as buying price and maintenance cost, with the target variable being car popularity.
				The trained model is then used to predict car popularity on the test dataset.  </li>
